- ### Custom Data Optimization: 
   The RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) stands out from traditional Language Models (LLMs) by leveraging custom data, a crucial factor that enhances accuracy and reliability in model outputs. Used `mistral 7B model` with `Embedchain` Framework

- ### Vectorized Input Processing:
  Input documents undergo conversion into vectors, and these vectors are efficiently stored in a database that is `vector db` here.

- ### Knowledge Retrieval:
  The architecture facilitates the retrieval of vectors based on user queries, enabling effective access to relevant information.
  
- ### Flexible User Inputs:
   Users can contribute to the model's knowledge base by providing links or documents as knowledge sources for the RAG.

- ### Real-time Traffic Updates:
  The system integrates live updates on traffic and routes, utilizing Google Maps APIs. This dynamic information is actively included in the model's training process.

- ### Enhanced Model Training:
   The incorporation of real-time data ensures that the RAG remains up-to-date, particularly in the context of urban mobility and route recommendations. This feature contributes to the model's adaptability and responsiveness.
- ### Lax.ai works on Google Maps API and a custom Machine learning model that predicts what is the most economic mode of travel between the given two places

- ### Challan Feature has OCR Feature using `pytesseract` that extracts the info from the image and is added to the chatbot's knowledge base for additional questioning
- ###  A common chatbot that supports all your queries regarding road safety and any important topic related to travel, It supports `22 Indic Languages` and is powered by `AI4Bharat's` model `INDICTRANS2` LLM.
- ### The query chatbot also has Speech to Speech conversation feature made out of a pipeline of `Distilled Whisper LLM` and `gTTS`, additionally we have also tested `PLAYHT` for the same use case
- ### The RAG models like Llama2 were fine-tuned with PEFT ‚Äî Parameter Efficient Fine Tuning methods like `Qlora` to save the VRAM efficiency

## Technology Used üíª

### Web: 

- React + Vite
- TailwindCSS
- Flask

### ML: üß†

- Data Scraping for real-time data(selenium & Beautiful soup)
- RAG powered models.(Mistral 7B model with finetuning)
- Indic language support. (Indictrans2 LLM from AI4bharat)
- Speech to Speech models ( Distilled Whisper and PlayHT with gTTS) for Indic languages support
- Finetuned Llama models on dataset for more efficiency
- OCR models for image to text
